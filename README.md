# Skin Lesion Segmentation

## Overview
Skin Lesion Segmentation is a Python-based project designed to analyze and segment skin lesions from medical images. This tool helps in identifying and isolating skin lesions, potentially aiding in the diagnosis of conditions such as melanoma. The project uses image processing and machine learning techniques to perform segmentation tasks on lesion images.

## Features
- **Segmentation of skin lesions** from image data.
- **Preloaded dataset**: Sample images provided in the `melanoma` folder.
- Modular scripts for **main segmentation tasks** and **testing**.
- Customizable for further enhancement with advanced algorithms.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt` if available or use the list below):
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Any other dependencies used in your project scripts

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd skin_lesion_segmentation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, manually install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your input images and place them in the `melanoma` folder (or any folder specified in the scripts).

2. Run the main script for segmentation:
   ```bash
   python skin_lesion_segmentation_main.py
   ```

3. (Optional) Run the test script to validate results:
   ```bash
   python skin_lesion_segmentation_test.py
   ```

4. Output segmented images will be saved or displayed based on script configuration.
